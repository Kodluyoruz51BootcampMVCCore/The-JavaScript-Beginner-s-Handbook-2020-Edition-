## Types

Variables in JavaScript do not have any type attached.

They are *untyped*.

Once you assign a value with some type to a variable, you can later reassign the variable to host a value of any other type without any issues.

In JavaScript we have 2 main kinds of types: **primitive types** and **object types**.

### Primitive types

Primitive types are

- numbers
- strings
- booleans
- symbols

And two special types: `null` and `undefined`.

### Object types

Any value that's not of a primitive type (a string, a number, a boolean, null or undefined) is an **object**.

Object types have **properties** and also have **methods** that can act on those properties.

We'll talk more about objects later on.
