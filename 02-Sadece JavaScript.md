## Just JavaScript

Sometimes it's hard to separate JavaScript from the features of the environment it is used in.

For example, the `console.log()` line you can find in many code examples is not JavaScript. Instead, it's part of the vast library of APIs provided to us in the browser.

In the same way, on the server it can be sometimes hard to separate the JavaScript language features from the APIs provided by Node.js.

Is a particular feature provided by React or Vue? Or is it "plain JavaScript", or "vanilla JavaScript" as it's often called?

In this book I talk about JavaScript, the language.

Without complicating your learning process with things that are outside of it, and provided by external ecosystems.
